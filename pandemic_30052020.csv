7 Essential Tips for Working From Home During the Coronavirus Pandemic

Hot Jobs on The Muse 
"In the midst of the new coronavirus pandemic, many companies are implementing voluntary or mandatory work-from-home policies That means lots of us are dealing with an unusual challenge: working from home for the first time, full-time "
"Even if you’ve done it before, working from home because of coronavirus might feel like a whole new world: It’s probably sudden It might be for an extended period of time rather than a day here and there (and you’re not at all sure how long it’ll last) Your whole company is involved And you can’t necessarily socialize in person outside of work "
"These tips will help you make sure that you’re successful, both at getting your work done and at maintaining your mental well-being: "
1 Get Dressed 
"It might seem like a simple tip, but it’s a crucial one Before coming to work for The Muse, I spent about eight months working from home when my full-time office job became a remote position with little warning It was tempting to stay in my pajamas all day, but any day I gave into temptation was much slower to start and less productive overall "
"You don’t need to dress as formally as you might for work, but the simple act of changing clothes serves as a signal that it’s time to wake up and get things done “Don’t underestimate the power of putting on clothes suitable for public viewing It makes you feel human [and] confident and helps draw the line between being at work and being at home,” says Heather Yurovsky, Muse career coach and the founder of Shatter & Shine “Feeling human” might seem like an odd thing to have to actively think of, but it’s especially important at a time like this, when the breakdown of your everyday routines might make you feel cut off from your “normal” life and the “real” world "
"Getting dressed also applies to other appearance-based tasks: Take a shower, brush your hair, even put on makeup if that’s what you’d usually do You don’t need to go as all out as you would for the office if you don’t want to, but waking up and taking care of your appearance can go a long way toward helping you feel like you’re taking care of yourself "
"Besides, just because you’re working from home doesn’t mean that no one from work will see you It’s 2020 and we’re all about to have a lot of video meetings "
2 Designate a Workspace or Home Office 
"One of the big challenges when it comes to working remotely is keeping your work and home lives separate “For some people it becomes very blurry,” says Muse career coach Lynn Berger, who specializes in helping people navigate career transitions If you never fully disconnect from work, your work productivity will suffer and your home life can take a hit as well "
"If you’re used to going into an office each day, the separation between work and home is physical, and you want to try to recreate that as much as possible with a designated physical workspace at home You may scoff at the idea of a separate room for a home office if, like me, you live in a small apartment I’m writing this in the room that is my office, kitchen, living room, and dining room all in one Your workspace doesn’t have to be its own room—in my apartment, it’s a corner—but it should feel as separate from the rest of your home as possible "
"Try to make your workspace comfortable with a chair you can sit in for eight hours a day and a few decorations Find an area with good natural lighting if at all possible Even if you don’t usually spend a lot of time outdoors, losing out on the time you spend outdoors during your commute can start to weigh on you quickly, and it will only happen faster if you don’t have natural light coming in "
"Entering your workspace will help you turn “on” at the beginning of the day and get down to work On the flipside, leaving your workspace will also help you turn “off” at the end of the day and fully disengage That’s why it’s also important not to spread yourself across your home—while it might seem great to be able to move from desk to couch to bed, if you let your laptop creep into your downtime space, it makes it harder to keep your work separate from your "
"If you’re working at a table you need to use outside of work or a room you spend a lot of time in, pack up your work each evening to make the end of your day decisive When I worked remotely in my last job, I was working on my personal computer, so I’d make sure to close all the tabs and programs related to my job as soon as I was done for the day The key here is to do whatever you need to do to “leave” your workspace "
3 Keep Clearly Defined Working Hours 
"Just as you designate and separate your physical workspace, you should be clear about when you’re working and when you’re not You’ll get your best work done and be most ready to transition back to the office if you stick with your regular hours Plus, if your role is collaborative, being on the same schedule as your coworkers makes everything much easier "
"“The biggest difference between working from home and working in the office is that you are in charge of your environment and have to treat yourself like an employee,” Yurovsky says This means holding yourself accountable, but also recognizing when enough is enough, just as a good manager might “If you feel yourself extending your work hours because you aren’t doing anything in the evening tell yourself it’s time to put work away, recharge, and start tomorrow with a fresh mind The work will be there in the morning ” "
"If you live with other people, this separation is even more critical Communicate with the people you live with to establish boundaries so you can cut down on distractions during the workday—and then disconnect and give the people you care about your full attention Having a separate time and space to work will allow you to be more present in your home life "
4 Build Transitions Into (and Out of) Work 
Your morning commute not only gets you to work—from one physical location to another—but it also gives your brain time to prepare for work Just because you’re not traveling doesn’t mean you shouldn’t carve out equivalent routines to help you ease into your workday 
"Maybe you usually read or listen to music on your commute You can do that at home Or maybe you can spend some time with a pet or loved one You can even add in a workout (preferably at home because of the new coronavirus, but see what is being recommended where you live) or spend some time on a hobby (again, make sure it’s appropriate given the health recommendations where you are) "
"At the other end of the day, the evening commute does the reverse “Commuters often take for granted the time they have in the car or on the train to wind down from a hectic workday and mentally prepare themselves for their evening routine ” Yurovsky says Generally, you’re not going from getting a huge presentation done right to making dinner or doing chores If you try to jump directly, “your brain doesn’t have time to hit the reset button, which can make you less present as you transition back into your personal life ” "
"Give yourself something that will signal the end of work and serve as a buffer When I worked from home, I made it a habit to take my dog for a long walk as soon as I was done for the day It helped me decompress with something physical and fun, and the habit was self-enforcing since my dog would lie in front of the door when it was time to go or would come looking for me if I was taking too long "
5 Don’t Get Too Sucked in by the News—or Anything Else 
"Distraction is one of the big challenges facing people who work from home—especially people who aren’t used to it “Your home is right in front of you,” Berger says That means that whatever you’re usually thinking about getting home to after work is now with you It’s human to get distracted But you need to be wary of how much you let yourself get distracted "
"You probably already take a few breaks throughout the day at the office, and that’s fine to do at home, too Using that time to throw in a load of laundry is OK, but try not to look at your new work arrangement as an opportunity to finally clean out that closet or anything else that takes a lot of sustained focus "
"Right now, one of the biggest distractions is the news And if you’re working remotely because of the new coronavirus, checking in on COVID-19 updates is going to be at the front of your mind It’s good to stay informed, of course, but it’s also easy to scroll yourself into an anxious mess "
"I suggest setting timers for any breaks you take You don’t want to get too immersed and forget that you’re at work altogether If you’re someone who’s susceptible to getting distracted every time you get a news alert, turn your notifications off during the workday, too The news will still be there after 5 PM "
"6 Communicate, Communicate, Communicate "
"If you don’t usually work from home, chances are there will be some bumps in the road if you have to suddenly go fully remote The key to steering through these bumps is communication—especially with your manager and direct reports Either before you make the switch or as soon as you know it’s happening, come up with a plan that lays out expectations for how often you should check in and how you’ll convey any changes or new assignments to one another Do the same with anyone you usually work collaboratively with throughout the day "
"This plan is likely to change as you go And that’s OK This is a new situation for everyone So make sure to circle back and change the plan if problems come up You’ll also encounter unique challenges as you try to do your job remotely, which can vary greatly depending on the type of work you do Don’t hesitate to reach out to the same people you would usually turn to for help—even if you’re not in the same building as them "
"And you don’t have to stick with only text-based communication “Do not default to email if you would have spoken to a coworker face-to-face while at the office,” Yurovsky says You might find it’s best to check in with your boss and coworkers over the phone or through video chat This will cut down on miscommunication and break up some of the social isolation that can come from working from home "

7 Don’t Forget to Socialize 
"When the whole office suddenly starts working from home, you’re cutting off a lot of the casual social interactions you’re used to having throughout the day that help you feel less lonely and break up the monotony of work “People forget they need to be around others because it’s the small talk and random fire alarms that keep your days feeling unique and prevent that hamster-wheel feeling When you work from home, you don’t have that,” Yurovsky says "
"Combat this by talking with your coworkers throughout the day through Slack, calls, text, Zoom, or however your company communicates If you usually ask your coworkers about their weekends, keep that up If you’d usually comment to them about a specific topic, reach out These little interactions go a long way "
Berger also suggests setting aside time to talk to or catch up one-on-one with a coworker When she’s working remotely she often “gets lunch” with colleagues and friends by setting a time to chat while they eat (And you should definitely still take a lunch and step away from your work These breaks are vital even if you’re not leaving your home ) 
"You can also schedule morning video call kickoffs with your whole team so you make space for that first-getting-into-work small talk, or carve out time for other check-ins throughout the day "
"While you’re at it, don’t just check in with coworkers about this project or that TV show you both like—really check in, Berger suggests Lots of us are feeling anxious and uncertain right now, and suddenly being isolated at home can amplify these feelings Don’t hesitate to reach out to a coworker just to ask how they’re doing "
"All this doesn’t just apply to the workday and people you work with You may not be able to meet up with friends for dinner after work, but you can organize a group of people to discuss a book or TV show or just to catch up over Google Hangouts You don’t even need to plan that much: My best friend and I live in different parts of the country but stream TV shows simultaneously so we can text about them in real time And Facetime your mom, will you? When the world is freaking out, it’s more important than ever that we reach out, connect, and take care of one another "

Coronavirus outbreak: Should I be stockpiling? 
"For those who might find themselves at home for an extended period of time, what is the best way to maximise productivity, maintain good physical and mental health, and not spend all day in your pyjamas when working from home? "
"We asked Karen Eyre-White, a productivity coach and founder of GoDo business organisation, for her advice on making the most of home working "
Distinguish between work and home mode 
"One of the biggest perks about working from home - slowly moving from bed to the sofa five minutes before you start - can also be your biggest challenge, says Eyre-White "
"Don’t forget that you are there to work - so set yourself up the right way, get dressed and brush your teeth at the start of the day rather than sitting in your pyjamas for eight hours “Switch from home to work mode,” she says, by having something you physically do to “flip the switch” "
"“Maybe it’s walking round the block [updated government advice says people are allowed to walk or run with members of their own household and in groups of no more than two people], making a special kind of tea, or lighting a candle at your desk It doesn’t matter what it is but do it without fail to create a strong association in your mind,” she says "
Be realistic about what you can achieve 
"“A wide, open day working from home can feel full of possibilities 145 things on the to do list? No problem! Don’t fall into the trap of being over-ambitious,” says Eyre-White "
Coronavirus: Streets around world left empty 
"Instead, she recommends being realistic and then possibly achieving more than you set out to; and feeling satisfied, rather than feeling disappointed you didn’t do everything "
"She suggests choosing three to five things to do and aim to get the majority done before lunch “We all slow down in the mid-afternoon and having a lot of your list under your belt will give you the momentum to power through,” she recommends "
Work in short bursts 
"In the office your day is broken up by everything from meetings to water-cooler chats, lunch breaks and even toilet breaks, but when you are sat at home on your own with no face-to-face interaction planned it can be easy to just work for long, unbroken pe "
"“When we’re in the office our day is normally broken up with meetings Although this can be frustrating, they divide the day up and create natural chunks of time,” explains Eyre-White “ In contrast, a day at home can be very unstructured ” "
"In order to be productive she recommends imposing structure on yourself For example, working in 45-60 minute chunks of focused work followed by a short break “This can be an effective way to break the day up and maintain your concentration levels,” she says "
Don’t forget to take breaks 
"It can be difficult to tear yourself away from your laptop if you’re worried people might think you’re slacking off, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t take breaks “Just because you’re feeling comfy at home, it doesn’t mean you don’t need a proper break,” says Eyre-White "
Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu? 
“Leave your desk for lunch and take advantage of being at home to walk the dog and blow the cobwebs away for half an hour in the afternoon You’ll return feeling refreshed and more productive for the rest of the day ” 
"This also includes making sure you make time to make proper meals and drink water regularly, rather than snacking continuously throughout the day and then crashing in a sugar slump at 3pm "
Manage distractions 
Being in an office gives us a limited number of ways to get distracted but when you start working in a new environment (especially a very familiar one) it can be easy to let yourself get distracted 
"“There are a lot of potential distractions when we work from home,” says Eyre-White “So proactively manage things which might interrupt your focus ” "
"She explains: “Keep them limited to short breaks in between chunks of focused work A change of scene is all we need to give our brain a break, and it’s the perfect time to put a load of washing on or empty the dishwasher ” "
Be sociable 
Working from home shouldn't mean that you don't socialise with anyone 
"“If you’re the kind of person who'll miss your colleagues when you work from home, build opportunities for socialising in to your day,” says Eyre-White, who recommends trying to call colleagues rather than always email or Slack messaging "
"“If you really struggle to apply yourself when you’re on your own, try virtual ‘body doubling’ - connect with a colleague via a Skype video call but both work ‘live' on your own project rather than chatting,” she says "
"For all the latest news on coronavirus, follow The Independent’s live blog here "
"Companies around the globe have rolled out mandatory remote work Whether you’re a newbie or WFH veteran, here’s what you need to do to stay productive "
"Google, Microsoft, Twitter Hitachi, Apple, Amazon Chevron, Salesforce, Spotify From the UK to the US, Japan to South Korea, these are all global companies that have, in the last few days, rolled out mandatory work-from-home policies amid the spread of Covid-19 "
"And it’s realistic to assume that shifting to the ‘home office’ will become the new normal for many of us for a while, given Wednesday’s announcement by the World Health Organization that the coronavirus has officially reached ‘pandemic’ status "
"Some employees will be working from home for the first time, which means figuring out how to stay on task in a new environment that may not lend itself to productivity But there are ways to deliver results and avoid going stir-crazy, from setting up a good workspace to the way you talk to your team "
Crank up the communication 
"Coronavirus or not, the key to working from home is clear communication with your boss – and knowing exactly what’s expected of you "
"“Have really clear-set expectations for communications day to day,” says Barbara Larson, a professor of management at Northeastern University in Boston who studies remote working “Ask [your manager] if they don’t mind having a 10-minute call to kick off the day and wrap up the day Often times, managers just haven’t thought of it ” "
"Most people spend their days in close proximity to their boss, meaning communication is easy and effortless But that’s all out the window with remote work, and communication breakdown is even more likely if your workplace isn’t used to remote working Your manager might not be used to managing people virtually, for example, or your company might not have a ready-to-go suite of tools for remote workers, like the chat app Slack or video conferencing app Zoom, Larson says "
"But even for those accustomed to it, working from home can feel unstructured and isolating Last year, a study of 2,500 remote workers by online brand development agency Buffer found that loneliness was the second-most reported challenge, one experienced by 19% of respondents Loneliness can make people feel less motivated and less productive "
"Out of sight, out of mind can be a real problem for remote workers – Sara Sutton "
"So when you do communicate with your boss and team from home, it helps if as much of it as possible can be “richer” communication that's face-to-face and instant, Larson says: video calls, Skype, Zoom "
"“Out of sight, out of mind can be a real problem for remote workers,” says Sara Sutton, CEO and founder of FlexJobs, a remote job listing site “The very best remote workers will reach out to coworkers and managers regularly” through a variety of tools "
‘Treat it like a real job’ 
"There are also some timeless WFH tips to call upon For example, just because you can lounge around in your pajamas doesn’t mean you actually should “Take a shower and get dressed Treat it like a real job,” says Larson "
"If you don’t have a home office, do as much as you can to create an ad hoc, bespoke space exclusively for work “Not having a well-equipped home office space when [people] begin remote working can cause a temporary decrease in productivity,” Sutton explains She says double monitors and a wireless keyboard and mouse make her more productive at home "

"So instead of lying in bed with a laptop, try something more deliberate The fix could be something as simple as moving a nightstand into a corner far away from distractions, plopping down your computer and sitting in an upright chair, like you would at your office desk (Be mindful of ‘tech neck’ and other ergonomic needs, though ) "
"This also serves as an important signal to those who live with you that you’re ‘at work’ “Create boundaries within your home that your family members understand: ‘When the door is closed, pretend I’m not there,’” says Kristen Shockley, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Georgia "
"With a dedicated workspace where you can concentrate, it becomes easier to unlock the benefits of remote work In a survey of 7,000 workers last year by FlexJobs, 65% said they’re more productive working from home, citing benefits like fewer interruptions from colleagues, minimal office politics and reduced stress from commuting "
"‘Psychological segues’, like a 20-minute morning coffee or afternoon exercise, can put you in the right working mindset "
"Yet it’s also important to bookend your day In that Buffer survey, the most-cited WFH complaint was the inability to unplug after work If you can’t commute or enter and leave a physical office, which provides clearer boundaries to the workday, Shockley suggests “psychological segues” that can help put you in the right mindset: like a 20-minute coffee in the morning and then exercise rig "
"“Even if childcare isn’t an issue, it’s still easy when you’re home [to think]: ‘I have laundry to do, let me do it real quick,’” she says “You have to [put] yourself in a frame of mind that you’re really working ” "
Avoid feeling isolated 
"Still, even with these tools, the enforced and abrupt nature of the transition from an office to a home environment could leave some struggling to get accustomed to the change "
"“The coronavirus is pushing everyone into this kind of extreme working from home,” says Nicholas Bloom, a professor of economics at Stanford University in California who’s given TED Talks about remote work He says there are two types of working from home: short-term or occasional work from home, and permanent or full-time work from home “It is kind of like comparing light exercise to marathon training,” he says "
"The latter is still quite rare – Bloom says only 5% of the US workforce, for example, report that they’re full-time remote workers With coronavirus, it’s not clear how long people will be at home, which poses additional problems Parents, for example, will find working harder if children are at home because schools are closed, meaning close communication with managers – who will need to be understanding – is vital "
"Experts say \high fidelity\"" communication like video calls while working from home fights isolation while safeguarding team unity and productivity (Credit: Getty Images) """
"Prolonged isolation could also potentially impact on morale and productivity That’s why Larson suggests teams try to sustain a semblance of normalcy and camaraderie in unconventional ways, like virtual pizza parties or remote happy hours where people dial in and share a cocktail on Slack or Skype "
"“It’s a good way to bond – it’s kind of weird, but everyone’s feeling weird, so it’s fun,” Larson says, describing the “we’re all in this together” mentality “It adds a little bit of levity and lightness to the otherwise difficult environment ” "
"Sutton also supports the idea of translating in-office social activities to an online environment “Celebrate birthdays, give public praise for goals reached and projects completed,” she says “Make time for casual conversations and ‘water cooler’ chat ” "
‘Keep spirits up’ 
"Make no mistake, these are stressful times Negative headlines, worrying about sick or elderly loved ones and fighting the urge to go panic buying for toilet paper can all put answering work emails on the back burner But the more effort you put into communicating with colleagues, the better chance you have of avoiding feelings of isolation, which can lead to depression "
"“Overall, a short-run period of say two to four weeks full-time working from home I think would be economically and personally painful, but bearable,” Bloom says “A longer period of, say, two or three months full-time working from home could lead to serious economic and health costs ” "
Solutions to work-from-home pitfalls include as much face-to-face interaction online as possible

"COVID-19 is feminine— to be used with the article “la”, not “le”— according the official guardian of the French language, which has urged an end to the widespread practice in France of referring to it as masculine "
"“The use of the feminine would be preferable,” the Academie Francaise said in a directive published on its website under the category “faulty use” "
“It is perhaps not too late to give this acronym back the gender it should have ” 
"The academy deplored the use of the masculine “le COVID-19” in the media and general conversation in France, saying the disease had wrongly been attributed the same gender as the germ that causes it: “le” coronavirus "
"It explained that COVID was an acronym for coronavirus disease, and that in French, the core word in an acronym is what gives it its gender- in this case, disease, which is a feminine “la maladie” in the language of Moliere "

"Dr PGR Pillai set up nine medical college-hospitals and allied services, many of which are in the forefront of the battle against COVID-19 "
"“The most important subject, in the current times, is public health,” says Dr PGR Pillai, who helped lay the foundation of Kerala’s medical infrastructure “I introduced a course on this along with eight other allied ones, at the School of Medical Education in Kottayam in 1994-95, For every doctor, we need five support medical staff, such as nurse, lab technician, pharmaceutical expert and such With the introduction of such courses, we could create an entire workforce to support the medical fraternity ” "
"As the man behind Kerala’s strong public health infrastructure, who set up nine medical college-hospitals and allied services, 80-year-old Dr Pillai can take a bow, along with frontline health workers and stakeholders as Kerala flattens the curve of infection even as rest of the world battles the COVID-19 pandemic “It may be something of a record because I think after setting up two (medical institutions), a person would get very tired,” he says with wry humour Now retired and settled in Kottayam, Dr Pillai, who graduated from the Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, in 1962 and did his Masters in General Surgery from Lucknow, is actively involved in several social projects "
"Kerala’s public health infrastructure has been one of the State’s most fascinating success stories It not only imparts a high quality of healthcare to its people, produces top-of-the-line doctors, health workers, and facilitates medical tourism to the State but has also come out in flying colours in this medical emergency "
"“I had been the medical superintendent of Government Medical College, for eight years when I was drafted, in 1991, to set up the medical college at Pariyaram in Kannur Till then, the State’s medical organisation consisted of the five government colleges at Thiruvananthapuram, Kottayam, Thrissur, Kozhikode, and Alappuzha This was the first ‘non-mainstream’ hospital constructed under the cooperative sector in India I was the founding principal and even organised requisites such as permitsfor construction,” he recalls Now a 12-storey structure, the Pariyaram Medical College Hospital is the largest in Kerala with 1200 beds and conducts super-speciality courses along with the regular MBBS degree "
"Dr Pillai’s next project as Medical Director of MG University was to found the School of Medical Education in Kottayam that provided, for the first time in India, eight under-graduate and postgraduate courses — Public Health, Nursing, Pharmacy, Physiotherapy, Lab technology, Medical Radiology, Microbiology, Hospital administration, Bio-Medical Engineering, Sports Medicine and Optometry — in Allied Medical Sciences "
"After this, Dr Pillai was deputed to set-up another medical college in Kochi in 2000 As founder-principal, he began work from scratch acquiring land, finalising the architectural design, recruiting the teaching staff, getting clearances from the Indian Medical Council and more “We acquired 65 acres of land in the heart of the city I remember getting avenue trees planted,” says Dr Pillai, proud that today the hospital is the main centre for COVID-19 patients and is fighting the pandemic "
"Given Dr Pillai’s expertise in setting up college-hospitals, he was given a five-year extension when he turned 60 After a short stint with the private Jubilee Medical College in Thrissur, which he converted into a full-fledged medical college, Dr Pillai was tasked with a major project of setting up four more medical colleges in the state: at Manjeri, Kasaragod, Idukki and at Konni in Pathanamthitta He was also involved in the setting up of Paripalli Medical College (Kollam), a new medical college at General Hospital campus Thiruvananthapuram and at Haripad "
"“All the four were on government land, so land acquisition was not an issue,” says Pillai adding that the rules regarding the founding of medical colleges too had changed “Earlier a 1200-bed hospital could come up on 100 acres and a 500-bed hospital on 50 acres Now it has been scaled down to 300 beds on 20 acres These rules are different for the seven metro cities, Andamans and North East region,” says Pillai "
"Of the four, the college at Manjeri opened in 2013 and the Paripalli Medical College was inaugurated in 2017 Admissions have begun at the Idukki College and work is under way at Konni But the Kasaragod Medical College Hospital is now witnessing its finest hour, even before the scheduled inauguration in September It has opened its doors for treatment of patients with COVID-19 "
Close to his heart 
"One of his most distinguishing works and the closest to his heart was setting up the cancer centre in the Kottayam Medical College campus “This was unique as it is built completely on public funds,” says Dr Pillai who raised funds for the 150-bed facility along with the successive district collectors - KJ Alphonse Kannanthanam, Sheela Thomas and Sajan Peter "
"Dr Pillai is the current chairman of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan (Kottayam), Cancer Society and Lilly School for Disabled Students "
"The journey has not been easy and Dr Pillai has had to face many troubles “Many roadblocks and very many questions were asked There were long hours of waiting in corridors of power to get clearances… It’s been a Herculean task but I feel some good has been done for society It’s a contribution to history,” says Dr Pillai adding that the look on the faces of parents and children once they get admission is unforgettable “This has been God’s blessings, I must say ” "
Commendable that India has been able to keep COVID-19 cases low compared to other nations: WHO’s chief scientist 
Dr Soumya Swaminathan said the whole world has to be prepared for the ongoing transmission of infection for ‘many many months and for perhaps years to come’

Vaccine development 
"On vaccine development, Dr Swaminathan said many vaccine candidates are being developed in India, some in partnership with other groups and some on their own "
"“India will play an important role in vaccine development The world cannot have enough vaccines for everyone if India is not part of the process,” she said "
"It usually takes 10 years to develop a vaccine, but in the case of Ebola, it was done in five years "
"“The aim is to get a (coronavirus) vaccine out in a year or so Or even less if possible,” she said, adding that the process of developing vaccine will need global collaboration like sharing of knowledge, resources, tools and pooling of ideas to perform clinical trials more effectively "
"“I am very optimistic that some of these will be successful,” she said "
She added that the most vulnerable people to whom the vaccines should be first administered must be identified This includes frontline workers and people with co-morbidities 
"Prioritization framework needs to be developed, she added "

"A government campaign to raise awareness seems to be helping, at least for medical workers But it’s made only limited headway in countering the harassment and shunning that may be discouraging people from seeking testing and care and hindering the battle against the pandemic "
"When Arisa Kadono tested positive and was hospitalized in early April, she was only identified as a woman in her 20s in food business Soon, friends let her know that groundless rumors were circulating: that the family-run bar she helps with was a hotbed of virus; that she had dined with a popular baseball player who was infected earlier but she has never met; that she was sneaking out of the hospital and spreading the virus "

How service apartments in Chennai are faring during the lockdown 
"Grocery deliveries, sanitisation drives, movie nights for staff members: Here’s how Chennai’s service apartments are tackling the lockdown "
"In mid-March, Aartee Ramsahye — visiting Chennai from Mauritius for her husband’s medical treatment — checked into a service apartment Plans to return home a week later fell through when the lockdown was announced on the day of her departure “This is my first visit to Chennai, but we have been inside our room for the last two months We miss being outdoors, but the staff has been keeping us in good spirits,” says Ramsahye, who pays the room fare every 15 days in the hope the situation will ease and they can fly home soon "
"While apartments and gated communities have put lockdown rules in place — no visitors, no food deliveries, etc — we look at what serviced apartments owners are doing to tackle the crisis "
Safety first 
"At Ascott, which runs Somerset Greenways and Citadines OMR, several precautionary safety and sanitation practices are in place for their 200 guests (mostly expats who work in India, people here for medical treatment, and stranded travellers) “Guests who arrive at the property are required to sign a declaration detailing their travel history and health status They are screened for fever, cold or cough before entering the property and symptomatic visitors are sent to the medical centre for further assessment,” says Supriya Malhotra, Area General Manager – Chennai "
"Taking me through additional measures, Malhotra says guests are discouraged from crowding in public areas, sanitisers are placed at several spots, and the entire property is cleaned regularly Guests can cook in the attached kitchen or order from the in-room dining menu “We provide grocery shopping services; our staff buys the items guests need, sanitises them and then delivers them to their rooms Food ordered outside is collected at the gates, sanitised and delivered ” Both properties are being run with around one-third the usual operational staff “A majority of the staff is accommodated at the property, while we have managed to obtain passes for a few others to be able to travel to work each day All staff are provided with food, medical care, yoga sessions and the occasional movie night "

"Two guests from Sri Lanka and Australia are stuck at Corporate Inn in T Nagar and Anna Nagar, after flights were cancelled “The other four guests are regular clients who work in IT companies,” says owner Rajesh N Dave “No one has dealt with such a situation before and it will take the hospitality and serviced apartment sector at least six months to get back to normal, albeit with heavy losses ” His on-site staff has been provided with accommodation, food and essentials, and guests are being offered a discounted room tariff "
"The management of Lifestyle Residences in Adyar told guests to make arrangements to return to their hometowns/ countries “We currently don’t have any guests staying on the property; this was a deliberate decision on our part,” says co-promoter Nalini Radhakrishnan, adding, “However, we have four staff members who weren’t able to make it back to their hometowns They are staying in the staff quarters and have been provided with essentials, sanitisers and masks ” The management has used the lockdown to triple-sanitise rooms, surfaces and linen Radhakrishnan, who stays close by, visits the staff regularly and has provided them with board games etc "

Coronavirus | Doctors’ body requests Health Minister to reconsider discharge protocol 
"The revised discharge policy states that moderate cases of COVID-19 and pre- symptomatic, mild and very mild cases need not undergo tests before being discharged after resolution of symptoms "
A representative body of medical practitioners in government service of West Bengal has urged Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan to reconsider the revised policy for discharge of COVID-19 patients prepared in consultation with the ICMR 
"Noting that different strains of ‘SARS-CoV-2’ are prevailing across the country with separate morbidity and mortality profile, the Association of Health Service Doctors (AHSD) said, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines cannot be exercised uniformly everywhere "

"“And in this context if you remember even AIIMS Director (Dr. Randeep Guleria) had said that if these are not contained properly, the transmission rate would become higher.

"The World Health Organization has long referred to COVID-19 as “la”, and in Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, government websites and the media use the feminine form"
"Bread is masculine, beer feminine. In French, every noun has a gender, and that includes the disease caused by the novel coronavirus."
"COVID-19 is feminine— to be used with the article “la”, not “le”— according the official guardian of the French language, which has urged an end to the widespread practice in France of referring to it as masculine."
"“The use of the feminine would be preferable,” the Academie Francaise said in a directive published on its website under the category “faulty use”."
“It is perhaps not too late to give this acronym back the gender it should have.”
"The academy deplored the use of the masculine “le COVID-19” in the media and general conversation in France, saying the disease had wrongly been attributed the same gender as the germ that causes it: “le” coronavirus."
"It explained that COVID was an acronym for coronavirus disease, and that in French, the core word in an acronym is what gives it its gender- in this case, disease, which is a feminine “la maladie” in the language of Moliere."
"The World Health Organization has long referred to COVID-19 as “la”, and in Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, government websites and the media use the feminine form."
"The “Office quebecois de la langue francaise” also recommends its feminine use, and the Royal Spanish Academy has issued similar guidance, citing the same grammar rationale."
The academy opened the door to feminine versions of professions such as doctor and teacher last year.
"Dr. PGR Pillai set up nine medical college-hospitals and allied services, many of which are in the forefront of the battle against COVID-19"
"“The most important subject, in the current times, is public health,” says Dr PGR Pillai, who helped lay the foundation of Kerala’s medical infrastructure. “I introduced a course on this along with eight other allied ones, at the School of Medical Education in Kottayam in 1994-95,. For every doctor, we need five support medical staff, such as nurse, lab technician, pharmaceutical expert and such. With the introduction of such courses, we could create an entire workforce to support the medical fraternity.”"
"As the man behind Kerala’s strong public health infrastructure, who set up nine medical college-hospitals and allied services, 80-year-old Dr. Pillai can take a bow, along with frontline health workers and stakeholders as Kerala flattens the curve of infection even as rest of the world battles the COVID-19 pandemic. “It may be something of a record because I think after setting up two (medical institutions), a person would get very tired,” he says with wry humour. Now retired and settled in Kottayam, Dr. Pillai, who graduated from the Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, in 1962 and did his Masters in General Surgery from Lucknow, is actively involved in several social projects."
"Kerala’s public health infrastructure has been one of the State’s most fascinating success stories. It not only imparts a high quality of healthcare to its people, produces top-of-the-line doctors, health workers, and facilitates medical tourism to the State but has also come out in flying colours in this medical emergency."
"“I had been the medical superintendent of Government Medical College, for eight years when I was drafted, in 1991, to set up the medical college at Pariyaram in Kannur. Till then, the State’s medical organisation consisted of the five government colleges at Thiruvananthapuram, Kottayam, Thrissur, Kozhikode, and Alappuzha. This was the first ‘non-mainstream’ hospital constructed under the cooperative sector in India. I was the founding principal and even organised requisites such as permitsfor construction,” he recalls. Now a 12-storey structure, the Pariyaram Medical College Hospital is the largest in Kerala with 1200 beds and conducts super-speciality courses along with the regular MBBS degree."
"Dr Pillai’s next project as Medical Director of MG University was to found the School of Medical Education in Kottayam that provided, for the first time in India, eight under-graduate and postgraduate courses — Public Health, Nursing, Pharmacy, Physiotherapy, Lab technology, Medical Radiology, Microbiology, Hospital administration, Bio-Medical Engineering, Sports Medicine and Optometry — in Allied Medical Sciences."
"After this, Dr Pillai was deputed to set-up another medical college in Kochi in 2000. As founder-principal, he began work from scratch acquiring land, finalising the architectural design, recruiting the teaching staff, getting clearances from the Indian Medical Council and more. “We acquired 65 acres of land in the heart of the city. I remember getting avenue trees planted,” says Dr Pillai, proud that today the hospital is the main centre for COVID-19 patients and is fighting the pandemic."
"Given Dr Pillai’s expertise in setting up college-hospitals, he was given a five-year extension when he turned 60. After a short stint with the private Jubilee Medical College in Thrissur, which he converted into a full-fledged medical college, Dr Pillai was tasked with a major project of setting up four more medical colleges in the state: at Manjeri, Kasaragod, Idukki and at Konni in Pathanamthitta. He was also involved in the setting up of Paripalli Medical College (Kollam), a new medical college at General Hospital campus Thiruvananthapuram and at Haripad."
"“All the four were on government land, so land acquisition was not an issue,” says Pillai adding that the rules regarding the founding of medical colleges too had changed. “Earlier a 1200-bed hospital could come up on 100 acres and a 500-bed hospital on 50 acres. Now it has been scaled down to 300 beds on 20 acres. These rules are different for the seven metro cities, Andamans and North East region,” says Pillai."
"Of the four, the college at Manjeri opened in 2013 and the Paripalli Medical College was inaugurated in 2017. Admissions have begun at the Idukki College and work is under way at Konni. But the Kasaragod Medical College Hospital is now witnessing its finest hour, even before the scheduled inauguration in September. It has opened its doors for treatment of patients with COVID-19."
Close to his heart
"One of his most distinguishing works and the closest to his heart was setting up the cancer centre in the Kottayam Medical College campus. “This was unique as it is built completely on public funds,” says Dr Pillai who raised funds for the 150-bed facility along with the successive district collectors - KJ Alphonse Kannanthanam, Sheela Thomas and Sajan Peter. ."
"Dr Pillai is the current chairman of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan (Kottayam), Cancer Society and Lilly School for Disabled Students."
"The journey has not been easy and Dr Pillai has had to face many troubles. “Many roadblocks and very many questions were asked. There were long hours of waiting in corridors of power to get clearances…. It’s been a Herculean task but I feel some good has been done for society. It’s a contribution to history,” says Dr Pillai adding that the look on the faces of parents and children once they get admission is unforgettable. “This has been God’s blessings, I must say.”"

She said the whole world has to be prepared for the ongoing transmission of infection for “many many months and for perhaps years to come”.
"Dr. Swaminathan said it is not just enough to develop and test the vaccine, but it is also crucial to manufacture it, scale-up procurement and get health systems to vaccinate populations."
"Speaking on the National Technology Day, Dr. Swaminathan said, “I would like to commend and congratulate the minister and colleagues for having contained so far the COVID pandemic in India and having kept both the number of cases and the number of deaths very low compared to other countries.”"

"All participants, including Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan, addressed the conference online."
"“However, we know it is the marathon that we are running. It is not the sprint, and India and in fact the whole world has to be prepared for the ongoing transmission of infection for many many months and for perhaps years to come,” she said."
"According to the World Health Organisation, as on Monday there have been 39,76,043 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 2,77,708 deaths."

"In India, the death toll due to COVID-19 stands at 2,206. The number of cases is 67,152 in the country."
"Dr. Swaminathan, who served as Director General of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said there are many challenges in India in terms of over-population, over-crowding in many of the urban areas and poor access to healthcare facilities in some of the rural areas."
"“This is the time, actually, for us to strengthen public health surveillance, primary health care delivery, and strengthening of the health workforce,” she said."
Vaccine development
"On vaccine development, Dr. Swaminathan said many vaccine candidates are being developed in India, some in partnership with other groups and some on their own."
"“India will play an important role in vaccine development. The world cannot have enough vaccines for everyone if India is not part of the process,” she said."
"It usually takes 10 years to develop a vaccine, but in the case of Ebola, it was done in five years."
"“The aim is to get a (coronavirus) vaccine out in a year or so. Or even less if possible,” she said, adding that the process of developing vaccine will need global collaboration like sharing of knowledge, resources, tools and pooling of ideas to perform clinical trials more effectively."
"“I am very optimistic that some of these will be successful,” she said."
She added that the most vulnerable people to whom the vaccines should be first administered must be identified. This includes frontline workers and people with co-morbidities.
"Prioritization framework needs to be developed, she added."
"Coronavirus | PM interacts with CMs on ways to strengthen containment strategy, boosting economic activities"
The meeting is also likely to discuss efforts to convert ‘red’ zones with high COVID-19 case load into ‘orange’ or ‘green’ zones.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday chaired a fresh round of consultation with Chief Ministers on ways to strengthen the COVID-19 containment strategy and stepping up of economic activities in a calibrated manner as the 54-day nationwide lockdown nears an end.
Large-scale movement of migrant workers from urban to rural India and the problems their return to home states may cause in restarting the economy will also be among the focus areas during the fifth virtual interaction between the Prime Minister and Chief Ministers since the outbreak of the deadly virus in the country.
"There will be an effort to ensure that all participating Chief Ministers get an opportunity to air their views during the interaction, as some of the them had complained that they were not allowed to put forth their views during the last interaction on April 27."
"At a meeting on Sunday with Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba, state chief secretaries told him that “while protection is required from COVID-19, economic activities also need to be stepped up in a calibrated manner”, according to an official statement."

"With thousands of migrant workers taking special trains to go back to their home states, the restarting of industrial activities will prove to be a challenge for states though several relaxations have been made in labour laws to increase factory output."
The meeting is also likely to discuss efforts to convert ‘red’ zones with high COVID-19 case load into ‘orange’ or ‘green’ zones.
"The Prime Minister interacted with the Chief Ministers last on April 27. Days after the meeting, the central government had extended the lockdown by two more weeks till May 17 to arrest the spread of the virus, but gave several relaxations in economic activities and movement of people."
"The nationwide lockdown has been in force since March 25 to contain the spread of the virus, which has killed more than 2200 people, and afflicted more than 67,000 in the country."

COVID-19: Rajasthan govt. allows movement of people without pass
The exemption will not be available in the areas where curfew has been clamped after the detection of a large number of positive cases.
"The Rajasthan government on May 11 allowed movement of people within the districts and to other districts in the State without pass, while relaxing the guidelines with new exemptions for travel from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. The exemption will not be available in the areas where curfew has been clamped after the detection of a large number of COVID-19 positive cases."
The passes were earlier required for all inter-district journeys. Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Rajeev Swarup said here that no pass would be required for travelling for permissible activities within the State. The District Collectors have been authorised to issue passes for travel to other States by bus or train and for the curfew areas.
"In an order modifying the earlier guidelines, Mr. Swarup said that the emergency passes for medical issues, death or accident could be obtained from the State control room. The Collectors would send the data of outward migrants to the State-level team for updating the pendency."
"The passes issued by the respective States would be valid for those coming to Rajasthan from other States. Mr. Swarup said if the other State asked for a no-objection certificate from Rajasthan, the Collector concerned would issue it. In addition to the Collectors, the Superintendents of Police, Sub-Divisional Officers, Deputy Superintendents of Police, Tehsildars, Regional Transport Officers and Station House Officers of police stations would be authorised to issue passes to the people travelling to other States in their own vehicles."
"Transit passengers travelling from one State to another through Rajasthan would be permitted to enter after getting the consent of the State government of their destination. Besides, all persons coming to Rajasthan from other States will be home quarantined or sent to an institutional quarantine facility for 14 days."
"Coronavirus | Delhi HC declines to entertain PIL on protection, welfare of sex workers, LGBT members"
A detailed order from the court giving reasons for dismissal is awaited
"The Delhi High Court Monday declined to entertain a PIL seeking direction to the Centre and the AAP government to take steps to protect and provide welfare measures such as food, accommodation and medicines, to sex workers and the LGBT community during the coronavirus lockdown."
"A Bench of Justices Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Sangita Dhingra Sehgal dismissed the plea, by a lawyer, who had sought financial aid, food, shelter and medicines to sex workers and LGBT community members in Delhi to ensure their survival during the lockdown."
A detailed order from the court giving reasons for dismissal is awaited.
"Advocate Anurag Chauhan, in his petition, had also asked for constituting a committee for rehabilitation of sex workers."
The petition had also sought setting up of a separate helpline to counsel them and address their problems during the period of the pandemic.
"The petitioner said he had given a representation to the Delhi Chief Minister and the Lieutenant Governor on May 2, highlighting the grievances of the sex workers and the members of the LGBT community but no steps were taken, hence he moved the court."
Delhi airport using ultraviolet disinfection technology to fight coronavirus
"Handheld disinfection torch is also being used to disinfect desktop, laptops and other devices, tthe Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) said"
"The Delhi airport is using mobile towers, handheld torch and baggage tunnels that deploy ultraviolet (UV) rays to disinfect surfaces in order to combat coronavirus, the Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) said on Monday."
"The mobile towers are placed in properly cordoned areas of a terminal and the UV lamps inside them are used for disinfection, the DIAL said in a statement."
"Once an area has been disinfected, the UV power is switched off and the towers are manually re-located to other areas for a similar process, the DIAL noted."
"Handheld disinfection torch is also being used to disinfect desktop, laptops and other devices, it said."
"“These are germicidal lamps that produce ultraviolet light. This short-wave ultraviolet light...leads to the inactivation of bacteria, viruses and protozoa,” it noted."
The DIAL has also installed UV tunnels at Terminal 3 of the Delhi airport to disinfect passengers’ luggage.
"“A live CCTV feed of UV scanning process mounted at baggage reclaim hall allows the passengers to see the disinfection process, in which high-intensity UV lamps are being used for on-line disinfection of their bags,” it said."
"As shoes can also be a potential carrier of coronavirus, shoe sanitiser mats have been placed at strategic places, the DIAL stated."
"“These mats are soaked with chemical that will disinfect the shoes of the passengers,” it said."
"Sensor-based taps in passenger washrooms, foot operated sanitiser dispenser, sensor-based and paddle operated drinking water fountain have been installed for contactless usage, the DIAL said."
"India has been under lockdown since March 25 to stem the spread of coronavirus, which has so far infected more than 67,000 people and killed over 2,000 in the country."
"All commercial passenger flight operations have been suspended for the lockdown period. However, cargo flights, medical evacuation flights and special flights approved by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation have been allowed to operate."
"COVID-19: Aurangabad reports another death, cases rise in Pune"
"At least 34 new cases were reported since Sunday evening, taking Aurangabad district’s cumulative total to 602"
"Yet another death was reported from Aurangabad in Maharashtra’s Marathwada region on Monday with the district, along with Pune, reporting a fresh surge in COVID-19 positive cases."
An 80-year-old woman who tested positive on May 9 passed away early on Monday at Aurangabad’s Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) to make her the 14th fatality in the district.
"“On May 10, she was put on ventilator support after her oxygen levels plummeted sharply. Unfortunately, she passed away sometime after 1 a.m. today,” said an official from GMCH, Aurangabad."
"With the latest fatality, Aurangabad’s death toll has risen to 14."
"At least 34 new cases were reported since Sunday evening to take the district’s cumulative total to 602, said district authorities."
17 new cases in Pune district
"Cases continued to mount in Pune district as well with 17 new cases being reported since Sunday to take the district’s tally of cases — including deaths and recoveries — to 2,874, said health officials."
"The district’s death toll currently stands at 156, with 138 of these being reported from Pune city, 12 from the rural areas and six from Pimpri-Chinchwad."

"Speaking to The Hindu on the rise in cases in the district’s rural areas, Pune zilla parishad CEO Ayush Prasad said: “Cases have increased following a measure of relaxation of lockdown rules in the rural areas. The last two days have seen a rise of 17 new cases. Most of these are personnel engaged in essential services who live in Pune city but move around because of the nature of their vocation. These are mainly medical practitioners and other personnel.”"
Mr. Prasad further said that steps had immediately been taken to check the spread of the contagion by ensuring that the families of the positive cases were not similarly afflicted.
"Taking the new cases into account, the number of active positive patients has risen to 1,579 with 100 of them said to be in a critical condition."
Recoveries on the rise
"However, in a heartening development, the numbers of those recovering have also increased with as many as 1,139 persons across the district being discharged till date. On Sunday alone, as many as 194 were discharged from hospitals in Pune city itself and more than 200 from across the district, said officials."
"Health officials said that till Sunday, the samples of 23,511 persons had been tested in Pune district of which 19,802 returned negative. A total 2,409 persons were at present kept in quarantine facilities in the district."
"Along with Pune’s 156 fatalities, the death toll in Pune division — which includes the districts of Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur and Solapur along with Pune — now stands at 174, with Solapur reporting 14 deaths, Satara district recording two, and Kolhapur and Sangli each had reported one death thus far."
48 new cases in Solapur
Solapur had reported a surge of 48 new cases on Sunday — the district’s single-highest day surge to take its cumulative tally to 264.
"According to district administration authorities, nine of the new cases are police personnel."
"On May 7, a 58-year-old assistant sub-inspector who was posted at Solapur MIDC and tested positive for the virus succumbed during treatment."

ICMR issues guidance for appropriate recording of COVID-19 deaths to create robust data
"In its guidance for appropriate recording of COVID-10 deaths in India, the ICMR said deaths with inconclusive test results, but in which coronavirus symptoms are present will be recorded as “probable COVID-19” fatalities"
"COVID-19 would be recorded as an “underlying cause of death” when leading to pneumonia, cardiac injury and clotting in the bloodstream, among others, according to the guidance issued by ICMR for appropriate recording of deaths due to the disease in India."
Also read: ‘COVID-19 death is a wake-up call to improve surveillance in the area’
"Explaining the public health significance of recording the cause of death in the COVID-19 pandemic, ICMR said COVID-19 is a new disease and is a pandemic affecting all communities and countries and a robust data is needed in India to measure the public health impact of the ailment and to plan for timely health interventions."

"In its guidance for appropriate recording of COVID-10 deaths in India, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said deaths with inconclusive test results, but in which coronavirus symptoms are present will be recorded as “probable COVID-19” fatalities."
"Deaths in which tests are awaited with the presence of symptoms will be recorded as suspected deaths, while those testing negative but have symptoms will be mentioned as clinically-epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19, the guidance stated."

"Its clinical presentation ranges from mild to severe, and fatality depends on the severity of the illness, associated co-morbid conditions and age of patients."
"“Patterns of disease and patterns of death can come from only standardised recording of clinical disease history and cause of death, and therefore epidemiological surveillance of disease and death are important."
“Robust data is needed from every district and state in India to measure the public health impact of COVID-19 and to plan for timely health interventions and protect communities.
"“At the same time, other health conditions affecting populations need to be also monitored so that the health system is prepared for responding to the needs of the population,”’ the document stated."
"It lists forms where a health facility or a medical practitioner has to mention the sequence of events leading to death, which includes the immediate cause of death, cause of death antecedent to immediate cause, underlying cause of death and the manner of death, among others."
It is likely that COVID-19 is the underlying cause of death (UCOD) that leads to pneumonia in most of the deaths due to COVID-19.
"Patients may present with other pre-existing co-morbid conditions such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, ischemic heart disease, cancer and diabetes mellitus. These conditions increase the risk of developing respiratory infections, and may lead to complications and severe disease in a COVID-19 positive patient."
"“These conditions are not considered as underlying cause of death as they have not directly caused death due to COVID-19. Also, a patient may have many co-morbid conditions but only those that have contributed to death should be recorded,” the guidance document stated."
"The death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 2,206 and the number of cases climbed to 67,152 in the country on Monday, registering an increase of 97 deaths and a record jump of 4,213 cases in the last 24 hours, according to the Union health ministry."
The health research body also outlines the use of ICMR-NCDIR e-Mortality (e-Mor) software for recording the cause of death.
The ICMR-NCDIR e-Mortality (e-Mor) software app aids in recording and reporting the cause of deaths as per the national standards of death reporting laid down by the Office of the Registrar General of India.
"This software can be implemented by hospitals and district local registrar offices in a district (to record deaths occurring in residence). Institutions should register with ICMR-NCDIR or state authority for provision of authorised login credentials, the document stated."

"In Japan, pandemic brings outbreaks of bullying, ostracism"
"There are many other people who also have faced discrimination and prejudice,” said Ms. Kadono, who decided to speak out on her own behalf and that of other COVID-19 survivors and their families."
"The coronavirus in Japan has brought not just an epidemic of infections, but also an onslaught of bullying and discrimination against the sick, their families and health workers."
"A government campaign to raise awareness seems to be helping, at least for medical workers. But it’s made only limited headway in countering the harassment and shunning that may be discouraging people from seeking testing and care and hindering the battle against the pandemic."
"When Arisa Kadono tested positive and was hospitalized in early April, she was only identified as a woman in her 20s in food business. Soon, friends let her know that groundless rumors were circulating: that the family-run bar she helps with was a hotbed of virus; that she had dined with a popular baseball player who was infected earlier but she has never met; that she was sneaking out of the hospital and spreading the virus."
"It was as if I was a criminal, Ms. Kadono said in an interview from her home in Himeji, western Japan, after ending her three-week hospitalization."
"Apart from a fever on the first day and a loss of smell, Ms. Kadono had no major symptoms though she repeatedly tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. Her mother developed pneumonia and was briefly in intensive care at another hospital."
"There are many other people who also have faced discrimination and prejudice,” said Ms. Kadono, who decided to speak out on her own behalf and that of other COVID-19 survivors and their families."
"I really want to change people’s tendency to blame those who get infected. Apart from fear of infection, experts say the prejudice against those even indirectly associated with the illness also stems from deeply rooted ideas about purity and cleanliness in a culture that rejects anything deemed to be alien, unclean or troublesome."
"Medical workers risking their lives to care for patients are a main target, but people working at grocery stores, delivering parcels and carrying out other essential jobs also are facing harassment. So are their family members."
"I can imagine people fear the virus, but we are working hard at the front lines under enormous pressure, said a nurse in her 30s, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear she might be targeted if identified."
We also have our own families we care about. Discrimination against us just because we are medical workers is discouraging and demoralizing.
Another nurse was approached by a few mothers and asked to leave a Tokyo park she was visiting with her children. Some nurses are unwelcome at restaurants they usually eat at. Some are rejected by taxi drivers. The Health Ministry issued a directive to day care facilities after some barred the children of doctors and nurses.
A veteran nurse in the northern island of Hokkaido said the mother of one of her coworkers was suspended from work. The husband of another was told at a job interview he wouldn’t be hired because of his wife’s job.
"The nurses, both assigned to COVID-19 patients, were staying at hotels to protect their families while working under severe conditions without adequate protective equipment and testing."
"We understand people’s fears, but medical workers are doing their utmost to prevent infections at hospitals. We seek your support, said Toshiko Fukui, head of the Japanese Nursing Association."
"We are not asking for anything special. ... Just a word of thanks is a huge reward that boosts our motivation, Ms. Fukui said."
"The backlash against coronavirus patients may lead some who fall sick to avoid seeking medical care, raising the risks of infection spreading further, clinical psychologist Reo Morimitsu at the Suwa Red Cross Hospital said in an interview with NHK public television."
Reports said Japanese police last month found about a dozen people dead at home alone or collapsed on the streets who later tested positive for the virus.
"The virus not only infects our body but also our minds and behavior, harming us and dividing our society, Morimitsu said."

"Coronavirus | Scientists call for studying transmission in companion animals, lifestock"
"In a study, the researchers cited anecdotes of pets being infected with COVID-19 , including the case of a cat in Belgium."
"Scientists have called for studying the spread of the novel coronavirus across animal species, and between animals and humans, stressing the need to assess the impact of such transmission on food security."
"The review research, published in the journal Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases, identifies the critical need to understand the ability of the novel coronavirus to infect certain animals such as livestock, poultry, working animals like military service dogs, and species in zoos."
"According to the researchers, including those from the Western University of Health Sciences in the U.S., there is also an urgent need to assess transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 infection between humans and those animals."
"“The potential for zoonotic SARS-CoV-2 to infect companion animals has been a topic of much discussion,” said Stephen Higgs, Director, Biosecurity Research Institute in the US."
"In the study, the researchers cited anecdotes of pets being infected with the novel cornavirus, including the case of a cat in Belgium."

"“Contrary to earlier assertions by health agencies that the virus could not cause illness in pets, the cat developed both respiratory and enteric symptoms and took nine days to recover,” the scientists wrote in the study."
"They said large amounts of antigen were repeatedly demonstrated in the cat’s vomit and faeces over multiple days, which led scientists to conclude that the feline had been infected by SARS-CoV-2."

"“With over 3 million cases of COVID-19 and over a quarter of a million deaths worldwide so far since January, it is vital that we understand the risks posed by domestic animals as a possible source for human infection,” Mr. Higgs said."
How service apartments in Chennai are faring during the lockdown
"Grocery deliveries, sanitisation drives, movie nights for staff members: Here’s how Chennai’s service apartments are tackling the lockdown"
"In mid-March, Aartee Ramsahye — visiting Chennai from Mauritius for her husband’s medical treatment — checked into a service apartment. Plans to return home a week later fell through when the lockdown was announced on the day of her departure. “This is my first visit to Chennai, but we have been inside our room for the last two months. We miss being outdoors, but the staff has been keeping us in good spirits,” says Ramsahye, who pays the room fare every 15 days in the hope the situation will ease and they can fly home soon."
"While apartments and gated communities have put lockdown rules in place — no visitors, no food deliveries, etc. — we look at what serviced apartments owners are doing to tackle the crisis."
Safety first
"At Ascott, which runs Somerset Greenways and Citadines OMR, several precautionary safety and sanitation practices are in place for their 200 guests (mostly expats who work in India, people here for medical treatment, and stranded travellers). “Guests who arrive at the property are required to sign a declaration detailing their travel history and health status. They are screened for fever, cold or cough before entering the property and symptomatic visitors are sent to the medical centre for further assessment,” says Supriya Malhotra, Area General Manager – Chennai."
"Taking me through additional measures, Malhotra says guests are discouraged from crowding in public areas, sanitisers are placed at several spots, and the entire property is cleaned regularly. Guests can cook in the attached kitchen or order from the in-room dining menu. “We provide grocery shopping services; our staff buys the items guests need, sanitises them and then delivers them to their rooms. Food ordered outside is collected at the gates, sanitised and delivered.” Both properties are being run with around one-third the usual operational staff. “A majority of the staff is accommodated at the property, while we have managed to obtain passes for a few others to be able to travel to work each day. All staff are provided with food, medical care, yoga sessions and the occasional movie night."
Staff morale
"Two guests from Sri Lanka and Australia are stuck at Corporate Inn in T. Nagar and Anna Nagar, after flights were cancelled. “The other four guests are regular clients who work in IT companies,” says owner Rajesh N. Dave. “No one has dealt with such a situation before and it will take the hospitality and serviced apartment sector at least six months to get back to normal, albeit with heavy losses.” His on-site staff has been provided with accommodation, food and essentials, and guests are being offered a discounted room tariff."
"The management of Lifestyle Residences in Adyar told guests to make arrangements to return to their hometowns/ countries. “We currently don’t have any guests staying on the property; this was a deliberate decision on our part,” says co-promoter Nalini Radhakrishnan, adding, “However, we have four staff members who weren’t able to make it back to their hometowns. They are staying in the staff quarters and have been provided with essentials, sanitisers and masks.” The management has used the lockdown to triple-sanitise rooms, surfaces and linen. Radhakrishnan, who stays close by, visits the staff regularly and has provided them with board games etc."
"Explaining how the lockdown has impacted Ascott’s short-stay and groups segment, Malhotra says guests have had to cancel travel plans until May end. “Over 3,100 room nights have been cancelled at both our properties in Chennai between March and May 2020. We have had to close our swimming pool, gym, bar and restaurants, and have also suspended travel desk services during this period,” she says."
"For Radhakrishnan, it’s been worse obviously because they decided to close down as soon as the warning signals came. She says, “As March to June is the holiday season, followed by the wedding season, we were actually booked out for weeks. But we have had to cancel those and future bookings too in light of the uncertainty.”"
Coronavirus | Doctors’ body requests Health Minister to reconsider discharge protocol
"The revised discharge policy states that moderate cases of COVID-19 and pre- symptomatic, mild and very mild cases need not undergo tests before being discharged after resolution of symptoms."
A representative body of medical practitioners in government service of West Bengal has urged Union Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan to reconsider the revised policy for discharge of COVID-19 patients prepared in consultation with the ICMR.
"Noting that different strains of ‘SARS-CoV-2’ are prevailing across the country with separate morbidity and mortality profile, the Association of Health Service Doctors (AHSD) said, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines cannot be exercised uniformly everywhere."
"In February, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) had announced ‘severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as the new name of the virus."
"“As Gujarat, Maharashtra, Delhi are flooded with cases, with perceived scarcity of beds and apparatus, and high bed occupancy rate, the ICMR’s recent discharge protocol and advisory on quarantine stay may be applicable there as there is no other alternative. But in West Bengal and many other States where geographical spread is not yet established, discharging confirmed cases without....sampling can’t be the choice. Asymptomatics may potentially transmit the virus,” the letter, dated May 10, said."
The AHSD urged the Union government to take up State-specific focused intervention with the ICMR.

"Pointing out that the current COVID-19 outbreak has provoked social stigma, the letter said, if any coronavirus patient is released only on the criteria of not having fever, his neighbours may refuse to accept him in the locality."
"“It has also been experienced that coronavirus patients with mild symptoms or no symptoms are not encouraged for home isolation by his family and close relatives,” the letter said."
The letter further urged setting up of one testing laboratory in each district of the country.
"Besides, one additional RT-PCR laboratory should be identified in each district for frontline COVID-19 warriors by the Centre and new machines should be supplied without disrupting the ongoing tuberculosis elimination projects, the letter signed by AHSD general secretary Manas Gumta said."
"The revised discharge policy for COVID-19 cases announced by the Union health ministry on Friday said, coronavirus infected patients developing severe illness or having compromised immunity will have to test negative through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test before being discharged by a hospital."
"However, moderate cases of COVID-19 and pre- symptomatic, mild and very mild cases need not undergo tests before being discharged after resolution of symptoms."
